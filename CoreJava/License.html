Adobe Runtimes use digital certificates to secure protected content from unauthorized usage. Your Computer may connect to the Internet at the time of validation of a digital certificate in order to download current certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or to update the list of digital certificates. This access may be made both by the Software and by applications based on the Software. Digital certificates are issued by third-party certificate authorities, including Adobe Certified Document Services (CDS) vendors listed at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds">http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds</a>, Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) vendors listed at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=

<p class="c4">9.2 Terms and Conditions. Purchase, use, and reliance upon digital certificates are the responsibility of you and a Certification Authority. Before you rely upon any certified document, digital signature, or Certification Authority services, you should review the applicable terms and conditions under which the relevant Certification Authority provides services, including, for example, any subscriber agreements, relying party agreements, certificate policies, and practice statements. See the links on <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds">http://www.adobe.com/go/partners_cds</a> for information about Adobe’s CDS vendors and <a target="ADB-ESG" href=

For example, if you are located in the European Union (EU), you may have the right, upon certain conditions specified in the applicable law, to decompile the Software if it is necessary to do so in order to achieve interoperability of the Software with another software program, if you have first asked Adobe in writing to provide the information necessary to achieve such interoperability, and if Adobe has not made such information available. In addition, such decompilation may only be done by you or someone else entitled to use a copy of the Software on your behalf. Adobe has the right to impose reasonable conditions before providing such information. Any information supplied by Adobe or obtained by you, as permitted hereunder, may only be used by you for the purpose described herein and may not be disclosed to any third party, used to create any software which is substantially similar to the expression of the Software, or used for any other act which infringes on Adobe or its licensors’ copyright.</p>
